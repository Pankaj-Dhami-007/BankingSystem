# BankingSystem
The Banking System project is a Java application that allows users to manage their bank accounts easily. Users can register for an account, log in securely, check their account balance, and transfer money between accounts. The application uses a MySQL database to store user information and transaction details, ensuring data is safe and organized. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly experience for managing finances, making banking simple and accessible for everyone.
