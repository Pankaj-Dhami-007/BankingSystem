# BankingSystem
The Banking System project is a Java console application that allows users to manage their bank accounts easily through a text-based interface. Users can register for an account, log in securely, check their account balance, and transfer money between accounts. The application uses a MySQL database to store user information and transaction details, ensuring data is safe and organized.
